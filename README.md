### Pitch Outcome Prediction

#### Running the Program
To run the program locally, run the _app.py_ file in the _shiny_ folder.

#### Behind the Program
The _build_model.py_ and _make_images.py_ files create the _models_ and _images_ folders, respectively. These folders are relied upon by the program, but these files do not need to be re-run. They are included to provide further detail on how the model and content in the program was created.
Both of these files require the user to download all data from the dropbox into a folder called _data_.
